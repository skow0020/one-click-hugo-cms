    Hi! Welcome to Literary Quicksand. We’re a book blog based out of
    Minneapolis, MN. We feature a group of women writers from multiple countries
    who all come together over one thing: our love of books! We regularly post
    book reviews, book lists, TBR roundups, and more.
intro:
  heading: Our Founder
  text: >-
    I’m Joli Skow, and I had the idea for Literary Quicksand because I needed
    something to keep me honest about writing. I have an English degree, so
    being out of college, I miss the challenge of writing about what I’m
    reading. Books are an extremely important part of my life. I love to read
    them, hold them, smell them, sink into them as if they were quicksand.
    They’re my safe place when the world is hard. It’s this passion and love for
    books that led to my idea for a bookish blog, written by amazing ladies who
    share my bookish passion.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
